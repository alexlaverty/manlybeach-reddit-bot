 Northern Beaches          
 Updated:  2019-04-21 08:05:00    
 Surf:  clean 3-4ft ENE     
 Winds:  Light NW    
 Weather:  partly cloudy    
 Rating:  7/10     
Light cross-offshore winds tending NW to N'ly and plenty of waves this morning, with a mix of E/NE and S'ly swells, producing occasional 3-4ft sets at exposed beaches. Lots of waves right across the entire Northern Beaches region this morning, though we are expecting N'ly winds will pick up during the day so don't leave it too long.

Dawn Report: Very similar to the last few days, We've got a continuation of lovely E/NE swell with inconsistent 3-4ft sets on offer, but there's also a new S'ly groundswell in the water producing slightly smaller waves in the 2-3ft range. Winds are very light out of the north but there's a slight wobble through the lineup; it's glassy but as soon as the wind picks up conditions will start to bump up. So, aim for an early surf for the best waves. Tune in to the updated photo report around 8am.",True
